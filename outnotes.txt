Js out of browser --> To execute code out of the broswer => by V8 engine
JS for serverside development => fast and scaleable 
=> Prefered NoSQL: like mongo
=> Many possibilites
As node allows out of browser running of JS code
=> This code can be run in the terminal e.g. so no browser is required 
// node ... .js //

Node modules are required to do many further things
=> Node based on these modules and relies heavily on them
=> modules accessed in the beginning by defining a variable => require module
=> can be accessed throughout the code
Nodejs.org => find modules
